# Machine-learning-circuit-block
A basic ML circuit. The circuit initially predicts the value of an unknown bit (0 or 1). The user tells it if it's right or not. The circuit keeps updating the information and starts predicting the value more certainly.


The circuit is simulated in circuitverse.org
The output is represented by the bulb (single), 0--> OFF, 1--> ON
The user must press the buttons yes or no depending upon whether the value shown is correct or wrong.

Currently the circuit is limited to three guesses only, after three guesses, it'll reset to the initial state.
