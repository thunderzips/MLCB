# Machine-learning-circuit-block
A basic ML circuit. The circuit initially predicts the value of an unknown bit (0 or 1). The user tells it if it's right or not. The circuit keeps updating the information and starts predicting the value more certainly.


The circuit is simulated in circuitverse.org
